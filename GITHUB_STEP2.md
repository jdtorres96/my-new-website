# Step 2: Connect your local repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll see commands to push an existing repository. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if you're not already there)
cd path/to/anastasia-lyulina-clone

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-website.git

# Push your existing commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.
